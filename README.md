# Scribe-Automation
**ALL CODE BELONGS TO B.M.S. College of Engineering**

A huge opportunity for scribe automation is to design a system specifically to support visually impaired and blind students in the process of achieving high levels of independence while attending examinations, by automating their exam-taking process. The ability of students to control and independently answer questions through voice helps reduce their reliance on human assistance. The prime goal of the proposed application is to solve the problem of students being dependent on scribes to take examinations. Upon clicking particular keys on the keyboard, questions will be dictated by using the concept of speech synthesis, and answers can be given accordingly based on the concept of speech recognition. Hence, not only visually impaired students can benefit from this but it will prove to be useful for the other handicapped people as well.
